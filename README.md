  <b>Testistant  - Your Personal Testing Assistant</b></br>
  <sub>Over the past few decades, technological advancements have
revolutionised the software industry. Yet, most of the innovations and developments have been in the automation tools and development fronts. 
Consequently, testers also shift their attention from testing to tools, automation, and programming languages. Having all of these skills is certainly beneficial to testing, but at the same time, they have distracted a lot of testers from understanding and practicing the fundamental role of testing. There are very less core “testing tools” available today in the software industry. The majority of the available testing tools actually fall under the automation or test management category. The current rate of innovation in the field of "testing tools" has been very slow, which is also slowing down the evolution of the tester and software testing itself.
Modern software testers require powerful "testing" tools that can help them to think and test more effectively. In order to assist testers, we plan to develop a testing tool called "Testistant."
“Testistant” would be a thinking tool, that would prompt testers to think well by asking them questions and sharing guidewords. It will also guide them to resources, ideas, possibilities, considerations, suitable tools, test techniques, quality criteria, learning pathways, cheat sheets, checklists, etc.
In short, it will help testers to think well and test better. It would be built from publicly available resources and creative commons licensed materials. Testers would use it as a companion. It would also provide them with mind-sharpening challenges, exercises, and updates about the upcoming testing sessions/events. This tool aims to improve the state of practice in software testing by providing testers with essential and powerful testing knowledge that is often neglected or overlooked.
This tool would be developed as an open-source project, which could be made available for free to testers. 

<br>
<i> In the prototype, we have developed this test assistant using the fantastic askui library that supports us to control the machine at os level and automate whatever a tester might need for quick assistance. </i>
